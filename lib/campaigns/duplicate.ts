 * assembles, so every setting comes along, including the ones the campaigns
 * list never loads, and a field added to the model later is copied without
 * anyone having to remember this function.
 *
 * Four things are deliberately not carried over: the copy starts paused so it
 * cannot fire before it has been reviewed, it gets its own report share slug,
 * its tracked links get fresh slugs so click stats stay separate from the
 * original's, and the name gains a "copy" suffix.
